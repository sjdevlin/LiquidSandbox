"""
Script to create temperature profiles and a new experiment with samples assigned profiles.

Each temperature profile:
    - Ramps up from 20 to a fixed temperature over 30 minutes.
    - Then ramps down back to 20 over 30 minutes.
The fixed temperature is set in 0.5 increments from 34 to 50.
Finally, an experiment is created on plate with plate_id=5. For every active well on the plate,
a sample is created and a temperature profile is assigned. Wells are sorted by their well_index
so that profiles with adjacent temperatures are assigned to adjacent wells.
